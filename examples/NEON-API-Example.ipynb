    "### NEON API Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) continuously collects data across Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites and distributes these data via its web site. It's not a very friendly web site to use to grab data, requiring a lot of clicks and scrolls. However, they've provided an API so that we can write a script to collect data. \n",
    "\n",
    "This API, however, is also not as simple as many in that it has lots of nested attributes. For example, if you want to grab all the active ground beetle data, you first need to query the API for a list all LTER sites that have beetle data; this returns (among other things) a list of the URLs connecting to the actual data. So then you have to invoke another call to retrieve the actual data you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this serves as a good example showing that, despite its complexity, scripts can be written to navigate even convoluted APIs. \n",
